        websites and related applications, whether on a computer, phone, tablet,
        or similar device (these are all referred to as a “Device”), you are
        accepting the practices described below. As a global company, we operate
        in a number of countries and territories where the laws and customs
        differ. This Statement provides a general overview of our privacy
        practices; you can view certain country-specific information by
        selecting your place of residence in the jurisdiction links at the
        bottom of this Statement Information Collected When you access or use
        our Services, we collect information from and about you to provide a

        automatically. Other information we collect from different sources,
        including affiliated entities, business partners, and other independent
        third-party sources.

        When you use our Services by “clicking-through” from a third-party site
        or when you visit third-party sites via our Services, those third-party
        sites may share information with us about your use of their service.

        with us about other individuals, you must obtain their consent. You must
        obtain the consent of any other individuals if you are providing their
        data to us. In addition to the categories noted above, we may also
        collect location information if you have instructed your Device to send
        such information via the privacy settings on that Device, or, for
        example, if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information.
        We may use your location information directly and/or share your location
        with third-parties. We collect and share location information in order
        to provide you with relevant content, to analyze your use of our
        Services, to improve our Services and to provide contextual advertising
        or recommendations. For example, we may use your location to show you
        reviews of hotels, restaurants or attractions near you when you are
        traveling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any
        time in order to turn off the functionality that collects and shares
        location information and/or the functionality to tag your photos with
        location information. However, turning off location sharing may affect
        certain features we offer. If you have any questions about the privacy
        settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your
        Device or your mobile service provider for help. Information Uses We are

        Protection Regulation Privacy Statement (“GDPR Statement”) This GDPR
        Statement applies to persons in the European Economic Area (“EEA”),
        including those based in the United Kingdom. This GDPR Statement
        supplements our Statement; however, where the Statement conflicts with
        the GDPR Statement, the GDPR Statement will prevail as to persons in the
        EEA. You have certain rights regarding your personal data. Your rights
        with respect to your own personal data include the following: The right
        to request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a
        copy of the personal data we hold about you. The right to request to
        correct your personal data if it is inaccurate. You may also supplement
        any incomplete personal data we have, taking into account the purposes
        of the processing. The right to request deletion of your personal data
        if: your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which
        we collected or processed them; or you withdraw your consent if the
        processing of your personal data is based on consent and no other legal
        ground exists; or you object to the processing of your personal data and
        we do not have an overriding legitimate ground for processing; or your
        personal data is unlawfully processed; or your personal data must be
        deleted for compliance with a legal obligation. The right to object to
        the processing of your personal data. We will comply with your request
        unless we have a compelling overriding legitimate interest for
        processing or we need to continue processing your personal data to
        establish, exercise or defend a legal claim. The right to restrict the
        processing of personal data, if: the accuracy of your personal data is
        contested by you, for the period in which we have to verify the accuracy
        of the personal data; or the processing is unlawful and you oppose the
        deletion of your personal data and request restriction; or we no longer
        need your personal data for the purposes of processing, but your
        personal data is required by you for legal claims; or you have objected
        to the processing, for the period in which we have to verify overriding
        legitimate grounds. The right to data portability. You may request that
        we send this personal data to a third-party, where feasible. You only
        have this right if it relates to personal data you have provided to us
        where the processing is based on consent or necessity for the
        performance of a contract between you and us, and the processing is
        conducted by automated means. You will not have to pay a fee to access
        your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights described in
        this Statement). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request
        is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We may need to request
        specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
        ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of
        your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal
        data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In
        an effort to speed up our response, we may also contact you to ask you
        for further information in relation to your request. You can exercise
        several of your rights through the personal information section of your
        account.
